# Phone Charger Using Diodes
This project involves designing and constructing a phone charger using diodes for rectification, capable of converting AC mains voltage (220V) into a stable 5V DC output with a current of 1A. It combines essential electronic components like a step-down transformer, bridge rectifier, smoothing capacitor, voltage regulator, and LED indicator to create an efficient and functional mobile phone charger.

### Main Purpose
The primary objective is to provide hands-on experience in AC to DC conversion while reinforcing the practical understanding of electronic components and circuit design. The charger delivers stable voltage for mobile devices and incorporates a clear charging status indicator using an LED.

### Future Implementation
- Add a heat sink for the voltage regulator (LM7805) to manage power dissipation effectively.
- Enhance the design for higher power output to support more devices.
- Integrate USB ports for multi-device charging compatibility.
- Optimize the circuit for energy efficiency and improved thermal management.
- Explore the use of advanced simulation tools to test circuit robustness under various conditions.
