# phonecharger-using-diodes
The main goal of this project is to design and construct a phone charger using diodes for  rectification, that is capable of converting AC mains voltage to a stable DC output of 5v and 1A, with a maximum power of 50W. This project is supposed to efficiently act as a mobile phone charger. The device incorporates basic electronic devices.
